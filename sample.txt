Hello FastAPI!

This is a sample text file to test the file upload functionality.

If you can read this, it means:
    1. The HTML frontend successfully captured the file.
    2. The file was sent to the FastAPI backend.
    3. The backend read the file content correctly.
    4. The content was sent back to the frontend and displayed.

Congratulations, it works!
